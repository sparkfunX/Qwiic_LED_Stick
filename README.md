[*Qwiic LED Stick (SPX-14783)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14783)

The Qwiic LED Stick features ten addressable APA102 LEDs, making it easy to add full color LED control using I<sup>2</sup>C. Write to individual LEDs to display a count in binary, or write to the whole strip for cool lighting effects. We’ve written an Arduino library that takes care of the I<sup>2</sup>C and communication to the LEDs so all you have to do is decide what color each LED should be.

This board is one of our many [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) compatible boards! Simply plug and go. No soldering, no figuring out which is SDA or SCL, and no voltage regulation or translation required!
